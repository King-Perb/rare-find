# Commit Splitting Strategy

This rule defines when to split changes into multiple commits vs. combining them into a single commit.

## General Principle

**One logical change = One commit**

Each commit should represent a single, cohesive change that:
- Makes sense on its own
- Can be reviewed independently
- Has a clear, focused purpose
- Can be reverted without breaking other changes

## When to Split Commits

Split into multiple commits when changes:

1. **Affect different concerns:**
   - ✅ Rules/standards changes → Separate commit
   - ✅ Bug fixes → Separate commit
   - ✅ New features → Separate commit
   - ✅ Documentation → Separate commit

2. **Are unrelated:**
   - ✅ Adding a new API endpoint + Fixing a bug in existing service → Split
   - ✅ Updating dependencies + Adding a new entity → Split
   - ✅ Refactoring + Adding tests → Split

3. **Have different scopes:**
   - ✅ `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` changes → `feat(rules): ...`
   - ✅ `src/main/java/**/controller/*` changes → `feat(api): ...`
   - ✅ `src/main/java/**/service/*` changes → `feat(service): ...`
   - ✅ `doc/*.md` changes → `docs: ...`

4. **Are large and complex:**
   - ✅ 20+ files changed → Consider splitting
   - ✅ Multiple features in one commit → Split
   - ✅ Mix of refactoring and new features → Split

## When to Combine Commits

Combine into a single commit when changes:

1. **Are tightly related:**
   - ✅ Fixing a bug + Adding a test for that bug → Combine
   - ✅ Adding a feature + Updating DTOs for that feature → Combine
   - ✅ Refactoring a service + Updating all call sites → Combine

2. **Are part of the same logical unit:**
   - ✅ Adding a new API endpoint with its service and repository → Combine
   - ✅ Setting up testing framework (config + setup files) → Combine
   - ✅ Adding entity + repository + service + controller → Combine

3. **Are small and focused:**
   - ✅ 1-5 files changed → Usually fine to combine
   - ✅ All changes in same directory/feature → Combine
   - ✅ Single feature implementation → Combine

## Examples

### ✅ Good: Split Commits

```bash
# Commit 1: Rules
feat(rules): add git workflow and commit standards

# Commit 2: Bug fix
fix(service): correct budget calculation for negative amounts

# Commit 3: Feature
feat(api): add investment portfolio tracking endpoints
```

### ✅ Good: Combined Commit

```bash
# Single commit for related changes
feat(api): add transaction management endpoints

- Add TransactionController with CRUD operations
- Implement TransactionService with BigDecimal precision
- Add Transaction entity and repository
- Update DTOs for transaction operations
```

### ❌ Bad: Too Many Unrelated Changes

```bash
# Don't do this
feat: add rules, fix budget, add API, add tests, update docs
```

### ❌ Bad: Over-Splitting

```bash
# Don't split every single file
feat: add TransactionController.java
feat: add TransactionService.java
feat: add TransactionRepository.java
```

## Decision Tree

Ask yourself:

1. **Can I describe this in one clear sentence?**
   - Yes → Single commit
   - No → Split

2. **Would reverting this break unrelated things?**
   - Yes → Split
   - No → Single commit

3. **Are these changes reviewed together?**
   - Yes → Single commit
   - No → Split

4. **Do these changes have different commit types?**
   - Yes (feat + fix + docs) → Split
   - No (all feat) → Consider combining

## AI Guidance

When helping users commit:

1. **Review all changes first** (per commit-standards.mdc)
2. **Identify logical groupings** - Group by concern, not by file
3. **Suggest splitting** if:
   - 20+ files changed
   - Multiple unrelated features
   - Mix of types (feat + fix + docs)
4. **Suggest combining** if:
   - All changes are part of one feature
   - Changes are tightly coupled
   - Small number of files (< 10)

## Practical Rule

**If in doubt, split.** It's easier to combine commits later (with `git rebase -i`) than to split them.
