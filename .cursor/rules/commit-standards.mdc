# Commit Message Standards

When creating commit messages, ALWAYS follow the Conventional Commits specification as defined below.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: maven, dependencies)
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

## Scope (Optional)

The scope should be the area of the codebase affected:
- `api`: REST API controllers and endpoints
- `service`: Business logic services
- `repository`: Data access layer (JPA repositories)
- `entity`: Domain entities and models
- `dto`: Data Transfer Objects
- `security`: Security configuration and authentication
- `config`: Configuration files
- `docs**: Documentation
- `workflows`: GitHub Actions workflows
- `workflow`: Camunda workflow definitions
- `frontend`: Frontend components and pages (Vue/React)

## Subject

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Maximum 72 characters

## Body (Optional)

- Use imperative, present tense
- Explain the "what" and "why" vs. the "how"
- Can include multiple paragraphs
- Wrap at 72 characters

## Footer (Optional)

- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`

## Examples

### Good Examples

```
feat(api): add transaction creation endpoint

Implement REST endpoint for creating income and expense transactions.
Endpoint validates input, updates account balances atomically, and
logs all financial operations for audit purposes.

- Add TransactionController with POST /api/transactions
- Implement TransactionService with BigDecimal calculations
- Add transaction validation and error handling
- Update account balance on transaction creation
```

```
fix(service): correct budget calculation for negative amounts

Fix bug where budget calculations incorrectly handled negative
transaction amounts. Budgets now properly track spending regardless
of transaction sign.

- Update BudgetService.calculateSpending() method
- Add test cases for negative amount scenarios
- Fix edge case in monthly budget aggregation
```

```
ci: add GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD

Add comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with:
- Maven build and test execution
- Code quality checks (Checkstyle, PMD)
- Security scanning (Gitleaks, OWASP Dependency Check)
- Branch protection setup workflow
```

### Bad Examples

```
❌ Updated files
❌ Fixed stuff
❌ WIP
❌ feat: Added new feature
❌ fix:bug in service
```

## Multi-line Commit Messages

For complex changes, use a detailed body:

```
feat(api): implement investment portfolio tracking endpoints

Add comprehensive REST API for investment portfolio management with
proper BigDecimal precision for financial calculations.

Endpoints:
- GET /api/portfolio - Retrieve user portfolio summary
- POST /api/investments - Add new investment holding
- POST /api/investments/{id}/transactions - Record buy/sell transaction

Services:
- InvestmentService: Portfolio calculation and aggregation
- MarketDataService: Mock market data integration
- PortfolioAnalyticsService: Performance metrics calculation

This establishes the foundation for Phase 2 real-time market data integration.
```

## Breaking Changes

Always document breaking changes:

```
feat(api): refactor transaction response structure

BREAKING CHANGE: Transaction API now returns data in a different format.
The response structure has changed from flat object to nested structure
with separate sections for transaction details and account information.

Migration:
- Update frontend components to use new response format
- See MIGRATION.md for detailed changes
- API version incremented to v2
```

## When Creating Commits

**IMPORTANT**: Before creating a commit message, you MUST:

0. **MANDATORY: Check and create feature branch if needed** (See `git-workflow.mdc`)
   - Run `git branch --show-current` or check `git status` to see current branch
   - **If on `main`**: MUST create feature branch first (`git checkout -b <branch-name>`)
   - **If on feature branch**: Proceed to step 1
   - **Exception**: Only if user explicitly requests committing to main (very rare)
1. **Analyze ALL changed files**: Run `git status` or `git status --short` to see all modified, added, and deleted files
2. **Review staged changes**: Use `git diff --cached` to see what's staged
3. **Review unstaged changes**: Use `git diff` to see unstaged changes
4. **Include all changes**: The commit message must accurately represent ALL changes being committed
5. **Group related changes**: For multi-file changes, group related changes in the body with bullet points
6. **MANDATORY: Update implementation plan**: ALWAYS update `doc/implementation_plan.md` before committing (if it exists). Document all changes including:
   - New features, services, controllers, or entities
   - Bug fixes that affect functionality
   - Refactoring that changes code structure
   - Test additions for new features
   - Configuration changes (application.properties, environment variables)
   - API changes or new endpoints
   - See `update-implementation-plan.mdc` for details on what and how to document

**Never create a commit message without first reviewing all changed files, ensuring you're on a feature branch (not main), and updating the implementation plan.** The commit message should comprehensively cover all significant changes, and the implementation plan must be updated to reflect those changes.

- Always use the format above
- For multi-file changes, group related changes in the body with bullet points

## Commit Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: When the user requests multiple commits:

- **Stop after each commit** - Do NOT proceed to the next commit automatically
- Wait for user confirmation or explicit request before creating the next commit
- This allows the user to review each commit before moving to the next one
