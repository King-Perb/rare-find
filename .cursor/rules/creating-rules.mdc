# Creating Rules and Standards

**IMPORTANT**: When the user asks about creating a standard, workflow, or long-term strategy:

1. **Create or edit `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`** - These are Cursor rules that guide AI behavior
2. **Do NOT create files in `doc/`** - The `doc/` folder is for human-readable documentation only
3. **`.mdc` files are for AI guidance** - They help the AI understand how to work with the codebase
4. **`doc/` files are for human reference** - They document processes for developers to read

## Examples

- ✅ User asks: "What should be our strategy for creating git branches?" → Create/edit `.cursor/rules/git-workflow.mdc`
- ✅ User asks: "Create a standard for code reviews" → Create/edit `.cursor/rules/code-review.mdc`
- ✅ User asks: "What's our branching strategy?" → If creating a standard, use `.cursor/rules/git-workflow.mdc`, not `doc/`
- ❌ User asks: "Document our git workflow" → Create `doc/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` (human documentation - this is explicitly asking for documentation)

## Rule of Thumb

- **"How should the AI work?"** → `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`
- **"How do humans do this?"** → `doc/` file (only when explicitly asked to document)

## File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `git-workflow.mdc`, `code-review.mdc`
- Be descriptive and concise
- Match the topic/domain of the rule

## Structure

All `.mdc` files should have:
- Frontmatter with `description` and `alwaysApply` (usually `true` for workflow rules)
- Clear sections explaining the rule
- Examples when helpful
- References to related `doc/` files if they exist
